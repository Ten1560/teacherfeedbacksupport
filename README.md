# Teacher Feedback & Support
This script (with some setup) sorts feedback and support using google sheets and forms.
# How to setup:
I: Create A Google Form.                           
II: Make the FIRST question be a dropdown or multiple choice with 2 options along the lines of Feedback, Support that each lead to a different section.                           
III: Have the Responses get sent to a New Google Sheet.                           
IV: Create 2 New Sheets within the google sheet and name them along the lines of Feedback, Support                  
V: Select the version of the script you want to use (I recommend the most recent one).                  
VI: Go to Extentions > App Script.                  
VII: Delete the default "myFunction" script and paste the one you selected.                  
VIII: Setup your settings.                  
IX: Click the save/floppy disk icon (ðŸ’¾).                  
X: Reload the google sheet.                  
XI: Test both the Feedback and Support.                   
  -I: If it worked you should see the Feedback on the page you specified as Feedback, and the same for Support.
